"[LPC] Desert Ruins" by bluecarrot16. Commissioned by Pierre Vigier (pvigier). Licenses: OGA-BY 3.0+, CC-BY 3.0+, GPL 2.0+. http://opengameart.org/content/lpc-desert-ruins


Ruined buildings---an ancient city, forgotten temple, or forboding dungeon---in the style of the Liberated Pixel Cup. Loosely inspired by ancient Egyptian and ancient Greek architecture.

Many types of structures can be built with these modular tiles. Check out the Tiled map "desert-ruins-preview.tmx" to see how the preview image was constructed. Some tips:
- The wall tiles at the top of the image are intended for interiors, but you can use them for exterior buildings too. Pieces in the top-right can be used to transition between the different styles of wall
- Add the slabs in the top-middle over top of any walls (interior or exterior)
- Ceiling trim (right side) uses the same layout as https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-walls
- Pyramids work best when the height is a multiple of two. This applies to both the smooth-walled pyramids and the stairstep pyramids (see building in the bottom-right of the preview)
- Statues are modular--freely combine the different partially-ruined heads and bodies.
